ABSTRACT:
Banks wanted to automate the loan eligibility process (real time) based on customer details such as Gender, Marital Status, Age, Occupation, Income, debts, and others provided in their online application form. As the number of transactions in banking sector is rapidly growing and huge data volumes are available, the customers’ behavior can be easily analyzed and the risks around loan can be reduced. So, it is very important to predict the loan type and loan amount based on the banks’ data.
